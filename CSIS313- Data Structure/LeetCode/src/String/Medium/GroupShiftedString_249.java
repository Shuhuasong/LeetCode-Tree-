/*
Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence: "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz".

Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence, return:
Eg: given: ["abc","bcd","acef", "xyz","az","ba","a","z"]
[
  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
  ["az","ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a","z"]
]
