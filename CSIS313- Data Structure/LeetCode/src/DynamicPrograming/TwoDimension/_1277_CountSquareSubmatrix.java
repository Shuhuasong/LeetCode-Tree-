Approach 1 : Bottom's Up DP
dp[i][j] represents the size of the largest square containing all ones with (i, j) as bottom-right corner.
If you think carefully
dp[i][j] will also represent the total number of squares containing all ones with (i, j) as bottom-right corner.

In bottomâ€™s up DP we have to fill the dp array line by line.

Construct an array dp[][] for the given matrix[][].
a) Copy first row and first columns as it is from matrix[][] to dp[][], reason being for entries in first row and column only one square can exist with those entries being the bottom-right corner, so it only depends whether matrix[][] is 1 or 0.
b) For other entries, use following expressions to construct dp[][]
If matrix[i][j] is 1 then
dp[i][j] = min( dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
Else If matrix[i][j] is 0
dp[i][j] = 0
Find the sum of all entries in dp[][] and return.
